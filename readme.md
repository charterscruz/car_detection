## About

This dataset containing aerial images of cars obtained in a gazebo simulation. 
These images are not photo-realistic and were obtained with the goal of training simple detectors. 
However, the process which was followed could be replicated with more representative images and therefore approximate a real world application.
For the detector, YOLO v3, the following repository was used: https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO. 
The training weights are also available in this repository.   

## Key Features

- Train images
- Test images
- Annotations
- Training weights


### Prerequisites

The TrainYourOwnYolo repository should be followed https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO to use the training weights.
If other model/implementation is used, then
